#**Introduction to reinforcement learning (RL) with code**

A quick introduction to general flow of RL!

* **qlearning_demonstration_MINT_notebook.ipynb** is a *Jupyter notebook* giving an overview of RL and an example code.
* **ai_training.py** does the same thing entirely in Python code.

* **environment_ttt.py** is an example of RL environment I implemented a couple years ago. Might give you some insights into designing one. 

I brought **example_qlearning.py** from the online article below, works very well!
If you want to see other people's code.
