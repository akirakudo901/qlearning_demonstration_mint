# **Introduction to reinforcement learning (RL) with code**

A quick introduction to general flow of RL!

* **qlearning_demonstration_MINT_notebook.ipynb** is a *Jupyter notebook* giving an overview of RL and an example code.
* **ai_training.py** does the same thing entirely in Python code.

* **environment_ttt.py** is an example of RL environment I implemented a couple years ago. Might give you some insights into designing one. 

I brought **example_qlearning.py** from [this online article](https://medium.com/swlh/using-q-learning-for-openais-cartpole-v1-4a216ef237df
), works very well!
If you want to see other people's code.

If further interested, tons of resources are online! Also feel free to ask me questions!
