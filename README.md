**Introduction to reinforcement learning (RL) with code**

A quick introduction to general flow of RL!

ai_training.py gives an overview of RL and an example code.

environment_ttt.py is an example of RL environment I implemented a couple years ago. 
Might give you some insights into designing one. 

I brough example_qlearning.py from the online article below, works very well!
If you want to see other people's code.

If further interested, tons of resources are online! Also feel free to ask me questions!
